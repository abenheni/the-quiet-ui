## About The Quiet Year

"The Quiet Year" is a map game about community building and struggle. The game guides players through a single year in the life of a post-apocalyptic community. Each season (represented by a suit) has its own mood and themes:

- **Spring (Hearts)**: A time of growth and discovery
- **Summer (Diamonds)**: A time of production and abundance
- **Winter (Spades)**: A time of harsh survival
- **Autumn (Clubs)**: A time of harvest and preparation

## Development

This project is built using:
- Vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks)
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- HTML5 for structure

The entire application runs in a single HTML file with inline JavaScript for simplicity and to avoid CORS/module issues.
